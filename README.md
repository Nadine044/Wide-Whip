# Wide-Whip
Wide-Whip is a challenging platform game where the player must overcome a series of challenges to complete the levels. The game has three main mechanics: jump, dash and bouncing on walls.
This game is created by two students of the CITM (UPC) on the Game Development subject of the degree, in the second year.
We programmed the game from scratch in C++ and we used free artwork.
